import numpy as np
import functools
import itertools

class PairFeatureExtractor(object):
    """Extract features from sequence pairs.

    For each feature, a grid is constructed for a sequency pair. The 
    features are stacked, producing a 3 dimensional matrix of 
    dimensions: 

    (length of sequence 1) X (length of sequence 2) X (number of features)

    For example, a 'beginning' character feature grid for the sequences,
    'kaas' and 'cheese' could look like this.

       c h e e s e
     k 1 1 1 1 1 1
     a 1 0 0 0 0 0
     a 1 0 0 0 0 0
     s 1 0 0 0 0 0

    These grids are made from two different types of feature
    functions: real and sparse.

    Real features are functions of the form:

        def some_feature_function(array1, array2):
            ...
            return feature_grid

    Given two sequences, s1 and s1, return a numpy.array with dimensions 
    (length of array1) X (length of array2).

    For performance reasons, we take advantage of numpy broadcasting, and 
    array1 is a column array and array2 is a row array. 

    For a 'matching character' feature between 'kaas' and 'cheese', the
    sequences are transformed and then we use broadcasting

        > array1 = numpy.array([['k'],
                                ['a'],
                                ['a'],
                                ['s']])
        > array2 = numpy.array([['c', 'h', 'e', 'e', 's', 'e'])
        > array1 == array2
        numpy.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]])

    When writing you own real feature functions, you can assume that
    the arrays will come in with the right shape.    

    Sparse feature functions look similar:

        def some_feature_function(i, j, s1, s2):
            ...
            return some_index, total_vector_length

    but they always return two ints. The first is the index of the
    element that should be 1 and the second is the total length of
    vector. So for example if (4, 5) is returned, then the feature
    vector [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] is constructed.

    vector are determined by which features are active at that position in the grid. So for the
    example above, the 'match' feature will be 0 in every vector in every position except the
    position indicated with '@', where it will be 1. The 'start' feature will be 1 in all the
    positions with '*' and 0 everywhere else.


    Parameters
    ----------
    bias: float: optional (default=1.0)
        A bias term that is always added to every position in the lattice.

    end: boolean: optional
        Binary feature that activates at the end of either sequence.

        Binary feature that activates when elements at a position are equal.

    numeric: boolean, optional
        Binary feature that activates when all elements at a position are numerical.

    transition: boolean, optional
        Adds binary features for pairs of (lower case) input characters.

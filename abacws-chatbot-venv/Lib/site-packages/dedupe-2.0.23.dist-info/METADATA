# Dedupe Python Library

[![Tests Passing](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/actions?query=workflow%3Atests)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dedupeio/dedupe/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=aauKUrTEgh)](https://codecov.io/gh/dedupeio/dedupe)

_dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data._

__dedupe__ will help you: 

* __remove duplicate entries__ from a spreadsheet of names and addresses
* __link a list__ with customer information to another with order history, even without unique customer IDs
* take a database of campaign contributions and __figure out which ones were made by the same person__, even if the names were entered slightly differently for each record

dedupe takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.

## dedupe library consulting

If you or your organization would like professional assistance in working with the dedupe library, Dedupe.io LLC offers consulting services. [Read more about pricing and available services here](https://dedupe.io/pricing/#consulting).

## Tools built with dedupe

### [Dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io/)
A cloud service powered by the dedupe library for de-duplicating and finding matches in your data. It provides a step-by-step wizard for uploading your data, setting up a model, training, clustering and reviewing the results.

[Dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io/) also supports record linkage across data sources and continuous matching and training through an [API](https://apidocs.dedupe.io/en/latest/).

For more, see the [Dedupe.io product site](https://dedupe.io/), [tutorials on how to use it](https://dedupe.io/tutorial/intro-to-dedupe-io.html), and [differences between it and the dedupe library](https://dedupe.io/documentation/should-i-use-dedupeio-or-the-dedupe-python-library.html).

Dedupe is well adopted by the Python community. Check out this [blogpost](https://medium.com/district-data-labs/basics-of-entity-resolution-with-python-and-dedupe-bc87440b64d4),
a YouTube video on how to use [Dedupe with Python](https://youtu.be/McsTWXeURhA) and a Youtube video on how to apply [Dedupe at scale using Spark](https://youtu.be/q9HPUYmiwjE?t=2704).


### [csvdedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe)
Command line tool for de-duplicating and [linking](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe#csvlink-usage) CSV files. Read about it on [Source Knight-Mozilla OpenNews](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-cvsdedupe/).

## Installation

### Using dedupe

If you only want to use dedupe, install it this way:

```bash
pip install dedupe
```

Familiarize yourself with [dedupe's API](https://docs.dedupe.io/en/latest/API-documentation.html), and get started on your project. Need inspiration? Have a look at [some examples](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples).

### Developing dedupe

We recommend using [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for working in a virtualized development environment. [Read how to set up virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Once you have virtualenvwrapper set up,

```bash
mkvirtualenv dedupe
git clone https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe.git
cd dedupe
pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If these tests pass, then everything should have been installed correctly!

```bash
pytest
```

Afterwards, whenever you want to work on dedupe,

```bash
workon dedupe
```

## Testing
Unit tests of core dedupe functions
```bash
pytest
```

#### Test using canonical dataset from Bilenko's research
  
Using Deduplication
```bash
python -m pip install -e ./benchmarks
python benchmarks/benchmarks/canonical.py
```

Using Record Linkage
```bash
python -m pip install -e ./benchmarks
python benchmarks/benchmarks/canonical_matching.py
```
